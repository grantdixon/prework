	<h2> Bio </h2>

		<p> Nirvana was formed in 1987 in Aberdeen, Washington by Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic. Kurt played lead guitar and was the lead vocalist, and Krist played the bass. The band went through a slew of drummers, with their longest lasting and most well known drummer being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. The band only released 3 full length studio albums in their 7 year career, but their influence transcended the music and still to this day they inspire people around the world. In 1989 they released their first album “Bleach”, which established the group as a prominent member of the Seattle grunge music scene. Their second album “Nevermind” was released in 1991, and it included their smash hit single “Smells Like Teen Spirit”. Their third and final album “In Utero” came out in 1993. The bands amazing success came to a crash in 1994 due to the death of Kurt Cobain. Despite the short lived run, Nirvana sold over 75 million records, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in it’s first year of eligibility in 2014.
